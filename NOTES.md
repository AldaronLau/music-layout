# Notes
 - Unit of measurement: "Stave Space" - The distance between two stave
   lines (this is similar to what an "em" is for text typesetting).  I'm going
   to abbreviate it as SS.
 - I'm going to use the term "centerline" for the position of the middle stave
   line, "ascent" for the number of SS above the "centerline", and "descent" for
   the number of SS below the "centerline".
 - Indent a clef one SS from the start of the stave lines.

# Stem Direction
An alternative style for a stave with lyrics is all stems are up.

## Non-Beamed Single Stave Stem Direction
### One Voice
 - Above Center Line: Down
 - Below Center Line: Up
 - Center Line - 5 cases:
   1. Previous and next note are down: Down
   2. Previous and next note are up: Up
   3. Previous or next in the same beat or half bar is up: Up
   4. Previous or next in the same beat or half bar is down: Down
   5. Previous and next are in the same beat or half bar and don't
      match direction: Down

### Interval
For most instruments (other than string), the notes must have the same
duration.

 - Same as Simple Stem Direction for the furthest note from the center
   line in the chord.
 - If both are same distance from center, then it should be determined
   as though a note is on the center line (same 5 cases).

### Chord
 - Same as Single-Stave Interval Stem Direction, except
 - When the highest and lowest notes are the same distance from the
   center, then the direction is determined by whether or not the
   majority or the notes are above or below the middle stave line.
 - If the same number are above and below the middle stave line, then
   use the inner notes distances, as though they were outer notes.
 - If all notes are same distance from the center, then it should be
   determined as though a note is on the center line (same 5 cases).
