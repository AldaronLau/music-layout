# Smufly
"Smufly" is pronounced like "Smug", except instead of "g", "fly".

Loads a SMuFL compliant music fonts as vector graphics in pure Rust with
advanced score layout.  When you want to render a score, Smufly gives
you an iterator over [footile](https://crates.io/crates/footile)
`PathOps`, which you can easily pass right into footile.
