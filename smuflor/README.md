# Smuflor
Load a [SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org/) compliant music fonts as vector graphics
in pure Rust with advanced score layout.  When you want to render a score,
Smuflor gives you an iterator over [footile](https://crates.io/crates/footile)
`PathOps`, which you can easily pass right into footile.
